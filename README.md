# Google AI Overview Removal Chrome Extension

## Problems:
It seems after investagation that Google tends to cache "easy" queries, where it's almost imposible to block out, but we can still hide and than remove from DOM, but while blocking queries that are not "easy" is great, there's other side effects like the usage of "/" hotkey in order to quickly start searching without using mouse click towards the search input.

### Not "easy" query
```e.g -> query: "sprintf in go vs println"```

### Cached query which requests blocking is tough.
```e.g -> query: "how many states in the us"```
